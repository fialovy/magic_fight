# magic_fight

### wat?

Very simple text loop game. Cast a spell!

For the love of gods, make sure it's Python 3+ (preferably 3.10+). Then:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python magic_fight.py`

I originally wanted to make it jUsT wOrK with no dependencies whatsoever (and
made a dumb workaround for the upsidedown library for that very reason), but the allure
of mypy was far too strong.

So, sorry. There's a requirements file of the perfectly primitive sort. 🤪

### Recommendation

`alias myblackisort='black .; isort .; mypy .;'`

### How to Submit a Character

`C O M I N G   S O O N`

You can probably figure out the directory structure for yourself (or ask ChatGPT to
do it), but as a concrete lover of context ♾️😏♾️, I promise to actually add detailed
steps at some point.
